                    <p > Check out some of my personal projects like <a href="/projects">Papercut@Stern</a> or the <a href="/projects">Rim</a>. Many of these projects are using different technologies or are done specifically to learn something new. I like spend my free time testing out new technologies and honing my programming skils through these experiences. </p>

              <p>As a computer science major and a mathematics minor I have a strong insterest in Machine Learning and Distributed File Systems. These are the two subjects that are constantly being improved upon and I enjoy learning and experimenting with these developing subjects. In order to learn more about these subjects I spend my spare time experimenting with new sofware and hardware. Some relevent classes that I have taken are Data Structures, Linear Algrebra, and Introduction to Web Design. Now I'm currently taking Computer Systems Organization, and discrete mathematics. I've dabbled in many technologies such as android development, mongodb, Arduino, Rasberry Pi, and even hadoop and Apache Spark. The languages that I am most familiar with are Java and C. I am also very familiar with using Linux because I run Fedora natively with a custom kernel. </p>

                    <h2 class="page-title"> Rim</h2>
                    <p> Rim is a text editor that I'm building from scratch. Rim is meant to copy a lot of the core functionality of vim such easy navigation around a file. I'm using this text editor project to learn more about vim, C, and about building larger scale applications, since I'm focusing on making the program efficient. You can check out the progress I've made the program on <a href="https://github.com/ronald-rojas/rim"> github</a>.

                    </h2>
                    <p> This was a hack for my worksplace at Stern Information Technology department. Stern's IT department has a license for the Papercut application which came with support native support for both Windows and Mac but not Linux. I made the linux compatible version of the software that is configured to work on the Stern network. Now every user in can use the Papercut Application! My favorite part of creating this application was creating a shell script in order for a new user to easily install the application. The has been tested to work on Ubuntu and and linux Mint, it should also work for all other bebian based versions of linux. All the user has to do now is run the Install script and follow the prompts that follow. Check out the code on my <a href="https://github.com/Ronald-Rojas/SternPapercut-Linux">Github</a> if you want to use or check out the application.

                <p> In order to better understand how computers work I procured some hardware from my friends and worksplace and set up a personal server. I currently have two servers with a third in the works. This first server, which I call Jeeves, runs on the standard user version of Ubuntu version 14.04 LTS. The second one, which I call Alfred, runs on the the Ubuntu Server version so there is no UI for it. Alfred is also running raid 0 on two 80GB hard drives. Both have openssh insalled for remote access. I am currently working on setting them setting them up communicate with each other to form a two node cluster!  </p>
